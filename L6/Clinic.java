/*
Give the definition of two classes, Patient and Billing, whose objects are records for a clinic. 

Patient will be derived from the class Person. A Patient record has the patientâ€™s name (inherited from the class Person) and primary physician, of type Doctor . A Billing object will contain a Patient object, a Doctor

object, and an amount due of type double. Be sure your classes have a reasonable

complement of constructors, accessor, and mutator member functions,

an overloaded assignment operator, and a copy constructor. First write a driver

program to test all your member functions, and then write a test program

that creates at least two patients, at least two doctors, and at least two Billing

records, then prints out the total income from the Billing records.
